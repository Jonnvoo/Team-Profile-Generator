# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This application was made to produce an HTML file once you run it in node.js. You are asked to add a team member to your company. Once you add a team member you are then given a series of questions about that person. Then depending on their role in the company different questions will appear for various roles. You are allowed to add as many team members as you want but once you finished you would then click the "quit" option to exit out the prompts and create your HTML file filled with your team members and their information.
